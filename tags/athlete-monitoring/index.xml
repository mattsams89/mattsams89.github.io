      <description>WhoopsA RefresherAnomaly DetectionRM ANOVA vs. Mixed ModelingBuilding a ModelVisualizing the DataBuilding the ModelWrapping UpWhoopsAlright, so maybe I’m a liar and part 2 took…a while…to come to fruition. Sorry about that. In my defense, I’ve traveled to four different countries for work, worked on sprint step analysis for @DrBradDeWeese (hopefully we can share some of that soon), and bought a new laptop without any of my blogging packages installed so at least cut me a little slack.</description>

      <description>Getting Back into the Swing of ThingsStatistical Process Control (SPC)Performing SPC in RGetting FancyWrapping UpCode RecapReferencesGetting Back into the Swing of ThingsWell, it’s been a hot minute since my last post (whoops!). I’ve been busy with bobsledders and job hunting this summer, but I’ve finally found a bit of time to get back to the ole blog now that bobsled’s summer training is winding down and I’m preparing for an intercontinental move (keep an eye on Twitter for related news).</description>

      <description>Acute:Chronic Workload Ratios?An Extremely Hot TopicCalculating ACWR in RThe DataMore Than One Way to Skin a CatCoupled vs. UncoupledWrapping UpCode RecapReferencesAcute:Chronic Workload Ratios?If you’ve been keeping up with the athlete workload monitoring world, you’ve probably heard of the concept of acute:chronic workload ratios (ACWR). In case you haven’t, the concept is relatively simple: how does the recently accumulated training load for an athlete (typically the last 3 - 7 days) compare to their chronic accumulation of training load (previous 3 - 6 weeks of training)?</description>
