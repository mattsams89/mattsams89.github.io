      <description>WhoopsA RefresherAnomaly DetectionRM ANOVA vs. Mixed ModelingBuilding a ModelVisualizing the DataBuilding the ModelWrapping UpWhoopsAlright, so maybe I’m a liar and part 2 took…a while…to come to fruition. Sorry about that.

      <description>Getting Back into the Swing of ThingsStatistical Process Control (SPC)Performing SPC in RGetting FancyWrapping UpCode RecapReferencesGetting Back into the Swing of ThingsWell, it’s been a hot minute since my last post (whoops!). I’ve been busy with bobsledders and job hunting this summer, but I’ve finally found a bit of time to get back to the ole blog now that bobsled’s summer training is winding down and I’m preparing for an intercontinental move (keep an eye on Twitter for related news).</description>
