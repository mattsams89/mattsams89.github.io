      <description>Hitting the Ground RunningIt’s Predicting TimeIdentifying AnomaliesWrapping UpHitting the Ground RunningThis post assumes you’ve already read part 1 and part 2 for “Individual Athlete Monitoring in R.” If you haven’t I’d suggest you go back to part 2 for some context for this post. Otherwise, you’re going to be pretty lost. Let’s go.
It’s Predicting TimeLast time, we built a linear mixed model with the lme4 package called final model.</description>

      <description>WhoopsA RefresherAnomaly DetectionRM ANOVA vs. Mixed ModelingBuilding a ModelVisualizing the DataBuilding the ModelWrapping UpWhoopsAlright, so maybe I’m a liar and part 2 took…a while…to come to fruition. Sorry about that. In my defense, I’ve traveled to four different countries for work, worked on sprint step analysis for @DrBradDeWeese (hopefully we can share some of that soon), and bought a new laptop without any of my blogging packages installed so at least cut me a little slack.</description>
