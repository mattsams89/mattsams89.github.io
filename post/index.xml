      <description>Getting Back into the Swing of ThingsStatistical Process Control (SPC)Performing SPC in RGetting FancyWrapping UpCode RecapReferencesGetting Back into the Swing of ThingsWell, it’s been a hot minute since my last post (whoops!). I’ve been busy with bobsledders and job hunting this summer, but I’ve finally found a bit of time to get back to the ole blog now that bobsled’s summer training is winding down and I’m preparing for an intercontinental move (keep an eye on Twitter for related news).</description>

      <description>Acute:Chronic Workload Ratios?An Extremely Hot TopicCalculating ACWR in RThe DataMore Than One Way to Skin a CatCoupled vs. UncoupledWrapping UpCode RecapReferencesAcute:Chronic Workload Ratios?If you’ve been keeping up with the athlete workload monitoring world, you’ve probably heard of the concept of acute:chronic workload ratios (ACWR).
